# oct2024_dataBC_week2

I primarily used Alexander's code and added many comments, changed variables and cells that the code was written to

I found it very difficult to wrap my head around VBA with the short time we had, and then confusing a lot of the code with Python

My goal was at least to understand the code and functions, as I felt helpless trying to make code myself. 

When I tried to utilize ChatGPT to assist with the coding, I just wound up going back to Alexander's code.

I want to revisit this HW another week with fresh eyes and have a cleaner slate to have my own approach and organization.

This exercise and doing the bit I did in trying to reorganize the code taught me many things. 

Most of my changes I had to revert, such as trying to see if I could treat openAmount like closeAmount and just use ws.Cells(i + 1).Value

The vast majority of the work is not mine, and this is mainly me trying to organize and set up knowledge so I could work on this myself.

I still put in effort with comments and other changes, but I want to put out that I do not want score for the most of the work.

Also, somehow my values for the second table are off, was trying to troubleshoot it for a long while, but couldn't currently figure it out.

Thank you!
